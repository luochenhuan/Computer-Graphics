#1. The final executable was compiled on this machine:
no special requirement

#2. How to invoke my program: 
1) ``./rt [lua file]``; without second argument, draw nonhier.lua by default 
2) draw bounding box: change global boolean variable ``drawBx`` in a4.cpp.
3) change MAXLEVEL in algebra.hpp to use mirror recursion.

#Notice!!!!!!
If the lua file you use contains other primitives from other lua file, you have to copy both of them to the same folder as the rt executable file. No idea why, maybe about the require command in lua file.

#3. How to use my extra features: 
I add ``mirror reflection``, by changing MAXLEVEL in algebra.hpp, the maximum recursion depth changes.
reflectin is turned off by default. After changing the parameter, do not forget to call make for recompilation.
screenshot02.png shows the reflectin effect of 2 recursions.
screenshot07.png shows the reflectin effect of 3 recursions.

#4. I have created the following data files, which are in the data directory:
self.lua & pyramid.lua

#5. Screenshots:
screenshot01.png shows the scene of nonhier.lua
screenshot02.png shows the reflectin effect of 2 recursions of nonhier.lua.
screenshot03.png shows the reflectin effect of 3 recursions of nonhier.lua.
screenshot04.png shows the scene of hier.lua
screenshot05.png shows the scene of nonhier2.lua
screenshot06.png shows the scene of simple-cows.lua
screenshot07.png shows the scene of macho-cows.lua
screenshot08.png shows the scene of self.lua (unique scene)
screenshot09.png shows the bounding box effect of self.lua
